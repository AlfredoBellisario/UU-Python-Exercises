a) matmult.py
most time: line 43, where we multiply the lists and store the new values in result
most memory: as time, but comparable with other lists' creation

b) euler72.py
Line 53, factorize() - most of the time and memory of the entire code is used here

c) I used numpy. While importing a library (especially big ones) can be time consuming, I compared the time to import random and numpy libraries, and didn't notice an important difference in time.
I recoded the script and printed each row. Afterwards I realized my output was a numpy array and therefor I decided to stick to the original design of the code adding the method .tolist().
I was surprised to discover an improvement in speed while printing each row.

Time (numpy array output): 0.2s
Time (list output): 0.079s
